            <p>
                Welcome to the section that is all about programming! When it comes to the projects that 
                I enjoy to make and find myself drawn to create have to due with projects that can be used 
                by anyoneâ€”regardless of their background. Which typically means I like to get some sort of 
                front end created for a user to use. I enjoy seeing how things can come together and challeneging 
                myself to create something new and different than anything I have never programmed. I have learned 
                that I learn bess by doing, in which I can learn new and more efficient ways of solving a solution or 
                figuring out how to arrive to a solution the very first time. 
                In this section I have the following sections. <a href="#languages"><b>Known Languages</b>, </a>

                <h2 id="languages">Known Languages</h2>
                <p>These are the list of languages that I feel confident in and will be willing to code any project in
                    <div class="bullet_list_language">
                        <ul>

                    I am currently growing my skills in web development with a focus in the following languages.

                <p>
                    The projects I am currently working on and the languages they are being written in are as follows.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>WorkOut Application</b> This will be an iOS app developed in <b>Swift</b>. The main focus of
                        this app will be centered around the tracking of someones personal fitness growth. It will 
                        keep track of how many times someone enteres the gym, what weights they did for a certain excercise 
                        and how many reps at that weight. It will also have an option for you upload photos of yourself
                        and be able to compare the photos with previous ones to track your physical appreance over time. 
                        With the main learning objectives of this project for me to learn how to use data systems in Swift 
                        and not just an application that doesn't get affected by the previous usages. 
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Voting Machine</b> This is a project I am currently coding for one of my class
                        projects. The premises of the project is to make a voting machine that only does not have 
                        ballets to be entered. But all of the voting will be throught a user interface on the voting machine.
                        We are tasked with deciding if the voting machine should have physical buttons on the side or 
                        digital buttons on the display. The main focus of this project is for us to work on several 
                        different groups with each group working on a specific part and than the groups come together to put 
                        it all together. So this projet will focus on different groups coming together and having proper 
                        communication to make sure everything comes together without any issues. The main learning objective that I 
                        personally want to work on is learning proper ways to have security in our code to insure that the votes can not 
                        be alterad to give the election to one of the candiadtes.
