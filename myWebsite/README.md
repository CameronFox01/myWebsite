# Personal Website

This is a personal project to teach myself **HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript**. I am wanting to make the website into a portfolio of who I am and which languages I know, and what projects naturally intrigue me. 

I feel as if this will be very similar to my resumé.Just with a pretty design and more personal design than just words on a page.

## Goal
My goal is to make this website a project that I am proud to show the people in my life who are not coders proud of me. I want the project to be a resource for future job oppertunities. A place for them to get to know more of who I am and be a placed where they are impressed with my skills. 

## Sections of Code
+ Home Page - *This has been Merged into About Me*
+ About Me
+ Work History
+ Coding Projects
+ University
+ Contact Page

### Idea for Overall Projects
+ A quote, or Bible verse to be added somewhere.
+ Find a design style to continue into each section but have small changes in each section.

### Break down of each Section
#### Home Page 
The **Home Page** will be what the user see's when they first enter the website. It is also where they will be taken back to after a submition has been made. It will give a break down as to what the website is about and it will explain each sections with a hyper link to connect to each page of the website. 

#### About Me
The **About Me** page will be focused around who I am. It will cover things such as a short introduction as to who I am. one to two sentences max. It will then cover what got me into **Computer Science** what my areas of intreset will be. 

#### Work History
This will cover my time at Dion's and all of my volunteering at church. Future updates would include any future work.

#### Coding Projects 
This will be the projects I have worked on and  that I am proud to talk about if asked about, and projects I am currently working on. 

#### University
My time at UNM When I expect to graduate and major and minor I am getting. I also want to be able to add the organization and groups I join at UNM. 

#### Contact Page
While hold all of the details to my LinkedIn and GitHub. I am hoping to get my Programming Business started so I can link those social medias to it. My Resumé should be downloadable from it. Should I have my email as well? I am a little worried about putting my phone number on the resumé because people would have direct access to it. So might take that and maybe my email out so only people I send my resumé to will have those two pieces of information already.

# Thoughts
It is opening at index.html but that isn't any page you can return to. Should I delete index.html or turn it into like a home page. Not sure what the homepage would even have. If I do not have it, what should I start as the main thing then??!?!?

# How to run the Website Locally
If want to just check one single page and not see everything open the file in google chrome.

## Want to use the Navigation Bar 
### Mac Options 
Go into myWebsite and run the following command " python3 -m http.server 8000 " and go to the website http://localhost:8000/index.html

## Want to use the Submition Box's
Go into myWebsite and run the following command "  php -S localhost:8000 " and go to the website http://localhost:8000/

### Using VS Code
+ Download **Live Server** 
+ Right Click on index.html and select **Open with Live Server**
+ Now open the server on **http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html** or something similar.
Note* It Will most likely open on it's own.
