        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Cameron Fox. I am a Computer Science student at the University of New Mexico, 
            born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My passion for computer science has been with me for 
            as long as I can remember. However, I didn't start coding until after graduating high school. 
            Before my coding journey began, I was always intrigued by electronics—whether it was photography, 
            video games, or learning how computers were built.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time I wrote code, I felt like I had truly found my calling. My first program was in
             Java—a simple "Hello, World!" script—but it sparked an excitement in me that hasn't faded. 
             Since then, I have loved discovering new and creative ways to code. Over the years, I've 
             realized that I enjoy building projects with a <b>visual component</b>. There's something incredible 
             about creating an application that anyone—regardless of their coding knowledge—can interact 
             with and see as a polished, professional product.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I love spending time with my family and friends, whether it's a <b>cozy night</b> in or an 
            <b>exciting adventure</b>. I have a deep appreciation for the outdoors and enjoy <b>backpacking, hiking, and 
            snowboarding in the mountains of New Mexico.</b> I'm also a huge fan of sports—whether it's <b>playing basketball, 
            watching soccer, or attending live games,</b> I love the energy and excitement that comes with it. When I'm 
            looking for a more laid-back experience, I enjoy <b>photography, exploring new restaurants, or getting lost in 
            a great movie or video game.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, I strive to balance my love for technology with my passion for adventure, creativity,
            and human connection. One of the key ways I do this is by incorporating creativity and a sense of human
            connection into everything I code.
