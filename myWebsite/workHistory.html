                    <ul>
                        <li>As Orientation Manager, I lead the onboarding experience across
                             all markets, ensuring every new employee starts with a consistent,
                              welcoming introduction to the company. I design and refine orientation
                               content, train facilitators, and collaborate closely with HR and
                                content managers to ensure compliance and clarity. This role has deepened
                                 my skills in leadership, public speaking, and process development. 
                                 I also look for opportunities to enhance the program, aligning the onboarding
                                  journey with company values while making it engaging and meaningful
                                   for each new hire.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In this role, I worked directly with new team members, introducing them to Dionâ€™s mission, 
                            vision, and values. I made sure that employees left orientation with a strong grasp of the 
                            policies and procedures they would need on the job. I collaborated with the Orientation 
                            Manager to improve sessions, and I took pride in creating a positive and supportive start 
                            for thousands of new employees. This experience taught me the value of communication, 
                            teamwork, and fostering company culture.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>As a trainer, I worked one-on-one and in small groups with new employees to teach 
                            essential food preparation skills and daily operations. I focused not just on technical 
                            accuracy but also on creating a supportive environment where trainees felt comfortable 
                            asking questions and growing in confidence. This role gave me my first leadership 
                            experience and taught me how rewarding it is to help others succeed.</li>
