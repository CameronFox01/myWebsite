                Hello my name is Cameron Fox, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of New Mexico with a passion for 
                building software that blends creativity, usability, and clean engineering. Born and raised in 
                Albuquerque, I’ve always been drawn to technology, whether it was photography, video games, or 
                taking apart electronics just to see how they worked.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I wrote my first line of code in Java, a simple “Hello, World!”, and instantly 
                knew I had found something special. I love creating projects with a <b>visual, interactive component</b>, 
                especially ones that feel polished and intuitive to anyone who uses them. I enjoy making ideas come 
                alive through software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I’m happiest spending time with the people I care about, whether it’s a 
                night in, exploring new restaurants, or heading out on an adventure. I love spending time outside: 
                <b>backpacking, hiking, snowboarding,</b> and enjoying the beauty of New Mexico’s mountains. I’m also 
                a huge soccer fan, specifically going to New Mexico United games.  
                When I want something more laid-back, you’ll find me enjoying <b>photography, movies, puzzles, or video games.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to build software that feels thoughtful and creative—tools that help people and bring ideas to life.
                I approach every project with curiosity and determination, always looking for ways to grow and refine my craft.
                 Ultimately, I want to create software that sparks creativity, solves real problems, and leaves a positive mark on the people who use it.
